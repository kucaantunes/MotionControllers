With the objective to perform a more effective training for users of different ages and disabilities and to make the learning process easier, an online motion controller was implemented via web using several programming languages like JavaScript. 
Open CV is able to detect the players movement. Via python code it is possible to detect the position of the hands during web camera video streaming. This technology detects the hands movement while the user is interacting with the online platform, allowing to control virtual objects that interact with the system.
Another possibility of getting hand movement instead of a camera is by the use of specific sensors like leap motion that has a library that allows to use the Unity game engine to develop applications which can be used for different areas like training and healthcare.
With JavaScript it is possible to develop applications that interact with the movement of the hands in real time, facilitating the use for people that have visual limitations or that do not have a keyboard or a mouse.

Learning activities can be more interactive and accessible for users of different ages and types of disabilities. Based on the context of training and to facilitate the performance of physiotherapeutic tasks a controller that detects, hands, arms, legs, head and feet was used to answer the third research question of this investigation.
Based on the creation of AI Agents, like the creation of a Computer-generated Imagery (CGI) girl, the sensor which in this case is the webcam requires to capture the all body in order to associate geometries and bones. A virtual girl replicates the user movements on a projected Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) that aims to help in physiotherapeutic terms by providing movements and exercises that can help some motor disabilities. The prototype was developed in C# using the Game Engine Unity providing a Mixed Reality (MR) experience. On a perspective of virtual storytelling, this project uses a process of providing interactivity to the user for story creation.
